# Cancer Detection Model

---

## Model Training

This model was trained using the LogisticRegression class in the [utils file](https://github.com/chidera-777/Cancer-detection/blob/52cdba0882148fbb67f9b2b88aeac733b0934372/utils.py#L1-L175). The class was created by me and I made use of regularization to reduce overfitting in the model.

Please can I get a star :pleading_face:
